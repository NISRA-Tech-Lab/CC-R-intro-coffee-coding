## Names of `r movie_name` characters

Below are charts displaying the age of characters in `r movie_name` using Plotly

```{r chars_plotly, echo=FALSE}

plotly_plot

```

and ggplot

```{r chars_ggplot, echo=FALSE}

ggplot_plot

```

We edited the full dataset of characters using dplyr. We removed the columns we didn't want, filtered for only masculine characters, created a new column with mutate, called "Total" and renamed the variable names that used American spelling.
The final edited dataset is shown below:

```{r starwars_edited, echo=FALSE}

kbl(starwars, align = "c") %>% 
  kable_styling()

```

Using this dataframe we can create a scatter plot that shows the heights of the top 5 species:

```{r starwars_species_heights, echo=FALSE}

ggplot_height_species

```
