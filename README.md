# R: Not just for technical wizards
## NISRA Coffee and Coding - R and RStudio Introduction

### Setup 
Download the .zip folder of this repo (green code button dropdown to top right, then select "Download ZIP").

Unzip this folder to a location on your machine e.g. Desktop

Open the folder and open the _"r-intro-coffee-coding.Rproj"_ file. This should open an instance of RStudio

From the files tab in the bottom right, open _"package_installs.R"_ and run this (Ctrl + A then Ctrl + Enter)
  - If the install lines flag up errors and do not work, you may have issues with installing packages on your machine and should speak to others in your work area to see if they are having similar issues, or post on the R user Forum.
  - You should still be able to run the script below up to the packages setion, even without completed installs, as the earlier parts use BASE R code only

Open _"r-intro-coffee-coding.R"_ and run through code
